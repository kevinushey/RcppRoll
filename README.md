RcppRoll
========

This package provides an interface for commonly-used math and statistical
functions as 'rollers', and also provides a utility function, 'rollit',
for generating your own fast, C++ backed rollers.

Install me with `devtools`:

    install_github("RcppRoll", "cdrv", subdir="RcppRoll")
	
and check some examples with

    example(rollit)
